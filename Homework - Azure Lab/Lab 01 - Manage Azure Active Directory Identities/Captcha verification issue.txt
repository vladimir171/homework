I wasn't able to complete "Task 3: Create an Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant (Optional - Lab environment issue)" and "Task 4: Manage Azure AD guest users" due to captcha related issues and couldn't proceed finishing the last two tasks


"Note: There is a known issue with the Captcha verification in the lab environment. If you experience this issue, please skip both this task and the next. We are working on a solution."
